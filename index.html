        <p>I have a formal training in Computer Science from TUM where I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree.</p>
<p>Broad areas of interest in AI and Machine Learning include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: A computational approach to solving intelligence that is the most promising in the long run. The field has come of age, and its learning algorithms are being used at a large scale in real-world applications. These include 3D protein structure prediction from amino acid sequence using AlphaFold2 (DeepMind), video compression on Youtube using MuZero (DeepMind), faster matrix multiplication using AlphaTensor (DeepMind), control of commercial cooling systems (DeepMind), conversational agents learning from human feedback (OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT), abstractive text summarization (Salesforce), learning a model for Covid-19 prediction (Kumar et al. 2021), air traffic deconfliction (Boeing), autonomous navigation of stratospheric balloons (Google), and the list goes on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continual Learning</strong>: Many of today&rsquo;s AI systems are trained on a large corpus of data for a predetermined set of tasks and then deployed. In the real world however, systems need to be able to learn new tasks and adapt to new situations as they arise. Continual learning is about systems that, once they are online and start learning, continue to do so indefinitely. Forgetting things and learning them again when needed is fine, but losing plasticity and being unable to learn again is bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meta-Learning</strong> or &ldquo;learning to learn&rdquo;. There are a lot of things to meta-learn such as different hyper-parameters of the system (perhaps different step-sizes for each hidden feature of a neural net), or the hidden features themselves. Meta-learning is linked with continual learning because once the system can continually learn it will have to learn how to learn better in order to improve future predictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Search and Learning</strong>: I am excited by problems that require efficient navigation through an astronomical space of possibilities to arrive at a &ldquo;useful&rdquo; solution using search and learning methods. These problems have enormous payoffs for the well-being of society as a whole. For example, predicting the 3D structure of proteins from the amino acid sequence alone used to take scientists months, years, or even decades until AlphaFold2 was developed. At its core, the algorithm uses <em>search</em> (via MCTS) and <em>learn</em> (via RL) to find the 3D structure of hundreds of millions of proteins in a timely manner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
