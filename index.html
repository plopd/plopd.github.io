        <p>I am a computer scientist with a bachelor and master degree from TUM.</p>
<p>Broad areas of interest in artificial intelligence include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong>: A computational approach to developing intelligent agents that can achieve goals in an unknown environment. The field has come of age, and its learning algorithms are being used at a large scale in real-world applications. These include 3D protein structure prediction from amino-acid sequence using AlphaFold2 (DeepMind), video compression on Youtube using MuZero (DeepMind), faster matrix multiplication using AlphaTensor (DeepMind), control of commercial cooling systems (DeepMind), conversational agents learning from human feedback (OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT), abstractive text summarization (Salesforce), learning a model for Covid-19 prediction (Kumar et al. 2021), air traffic deconfliction (Boeing), autonomous navigation of stratospheric balloons (Google), and the list goes on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continual learning</strong>: Many of today&rsquo;s AI systems are trained on large amounts of data for a predetermined set of tasks, and then deployed. In the real world, however, systems need to be able to learn new tasks and adapt to new situations <em>as</em> they arise. Continual learning is about systems that, once they are online and start learning, continue to do so indefinitely without external intervention or resetting. Forgetting things (to some extent) and learning them again when needed is fine, but losing the plasticity to learn is bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meta-learning</strong> or &ldquo;learning to learn&rdquo;. There are a lot of things to meta-learn such as different hyper-parameters of the system (perhaps different step-sizes for each hidden feature of a neural net), or the features themselves. Meta-learning is linked with continual learning because once the system can continually learn it will have to learn how to learn better in order to improve future predictions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
