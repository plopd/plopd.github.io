<li>It is incredible that, even with the best of intentions, we may not realise the fallacies of our thinking until we carefully review them afterwards &ndash; emotions &ldquo;interfere&rdquo;.</li>
<li>System 1 (fast and intuitive) and System 2 (slow and meticulous) are part of the human mind. But how did they form? What was in the beginning?
<ul>
<li>How should we think about these two systems when we design the computational mind? Is it the case that they are part of a whole, with more of System 1 in the beginning and more computational resources gradually being allocated to System 2? What is the interaction between the two?</li>
<li>It is clear that the mind must have a reactive part and an introspective part, neither of which would survive long alone, but together they prolong its life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Rational agents are expected to know their tastes, both present and future, and they are supposed to make good decisions that will maximize interests&rdquo;</em>.
<ul>
<li>This is a profound difference between a human and the rational agent from economic theory, who always makes decisions based on grounded reality. I wonder how we humans might evolve in the distant future as AI becomes more involved in our decision making. I suppose we would have some access to the &ldquo;human&rdquo; part, just as we now have access to the more ancestral layers of our brains. Perhaps the future of humanity lies in its artificial existence, adding another cognitive layer to our existing mind.</li>
