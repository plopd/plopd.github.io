        <p>Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP) &amp; natural language understanding (NLU) <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and image generation <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> have generated a lot of excitement and well-deserved enthusiasm. But&hellip;</p>
<p>Although people claim that these models learn by self-monitoring, they actually learn from human labeled data, which makes them supervised learning methods. Why is that?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the example of GPT-3, which learns from a huge corpus of text from the Internet. The model learns to predict the next word in sequence by recycling this corpus many times, and after some time it can accurately predict the next word, so it seems to have gained understanding and knowledge about the world. The problem is that it is learning about <em>our</em> world, not <em>any</em> world, because it is only allowed to consume the data that we humans have spent years creating and curating through all the countless interactions on the Internet.</p>
<p>Supervised learning is fundamentally limited to understanding the world of the supervisor of that data. As long as we feed a learning agent data from our <em>own</em> experience, the agent won&rsquo;t be able to learn anything truly new. The search for novel solutions becomes extremely important when it comes to finding a solution to a difficult problem. Essentially, the solution is in the data. But the only way for the solution to be revealed is through the agent&rsquo;s interaction with its environment. The agent must take actions and influence the data stream to produce that solution.</p>
<p>In summary, the most scalable way to find novel solutions to hard problems is to allow the learning agent to generate its own data from experience by interacting with the world.</p>
<p>Everything about the world is encoded in the world itself and only revealed through the interaction between the agent and its environment.</p>
